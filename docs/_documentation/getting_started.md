Welcome to the ZEI API !

This API document is designed for those interested in developing for our platform.

This API is still under development and will evolve.

You need to be authenticated by a **token** for all API requests (except the one that gives you the token).

In order to get a token with the "/token" GET call, you need to use your *API key* and your *API secret* in "My Tools"
on your Zero ecoimpact company profile.
