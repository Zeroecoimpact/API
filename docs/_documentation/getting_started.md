Welcome to the ZEI API !

This API document is designed for those interested in developing for our platform and use their ZEI offers and rewards.
This API is still under development and will evolve.

If you are not a developer... you can still use pre-build plugins on "Plugins" section.
For the moment, we made a plugin for *WooCommerce* (WordPress).

You need to be authenticated by a **token** for all API requests (except the one that gives you the token).
In order to get a token with the "/token" GET call, you need to use your *API key* and your *API secret* in "My Tools"
on your Zero ecoimpact company profile.
