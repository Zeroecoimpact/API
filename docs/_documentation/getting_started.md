Welcome to the ZEI API !

This API document is designed for those interested in developing for our platform and use their ZEI offers and rewards.
This API is still under development and will evolve.

If you are not a developer... you can still use pre-build plugins on "Plugins" section.
For the moment, we made a plugin for *WooCommerce* (WordPress) and *PrestaShop*.

In order to use some API requests, you will need to be authenticated by using your *API key* and your *API secret* in
"My Tools", on your Zei company profile.
